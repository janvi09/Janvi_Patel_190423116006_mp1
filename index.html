        <h2>It's Nature</h2>
        <p>
            Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life;
            however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets,
            writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories
            in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature 
            is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the 
            birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of 
            both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from 
            people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.

            A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form
            of a peak. A mountain is generally considered to be steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic 
            forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the Earth. Mountains erode slowly through 
            the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur 
            in huge mountain ranges.
            
            High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect 
            the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less 
            hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction 
            and recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.

            A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. 
            In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body 
            of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no
            official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features,although in some countries or 
            communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; 
            examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "burn" in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" 
            in northern England.
